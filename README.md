# CorrectHorsePower
Powershell script to generate long passwords based on the XKCD "CorrectHorseBatteryStaple" scheme.

Read the [XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/936/) to learn why this is a good idea.

The wordlist used in the script was found [here on github](https://github.com/dolph/dictionary).

Here's the output you get when running the script a few times:

```
PS C:\> C:\correcthorsepower.ps1
The following password is good for 102.4 bits of entropy:
adored_owing_plunging_whimsical_temperamental_recommended_handrail

PS C:\> C:\correcthorsepower.ps1
The following password is good for 102.4 bits of entropy:
origins_startle_empties_uncomfortable_explicitly_stubs_shells
